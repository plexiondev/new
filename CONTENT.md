## event datapacks

if you're using one of my datapacks, it'd be nice if you could:

* give some credit if possible (eg. Datapack created by [plexion](https://youtube.com/plexion))
* don't try and claim ownership of the datapack

the same applies for maps and *resourcepacks* - not too bothered about resourcepacks though

## clipping

in short, you can clip my content if you want, just remember:

* give some credit if possible (eg. Original video by [plexion](https://youtube.com/plexion))

## translations

don't re-upload my stuff with dubbed languages, just kinda annoying ya know - if you want to add closed-captions to one of my videos, just send me an email (or something idfk)

## at the end of the day

these are just here to let ya know, just don't be dumb
