As with any other datapack, there is an incredibly simple installation process:

1. Download the datapack .zip file and save it somewhere
2. In Minecraft, create a new world then press `Data Packs`
3. Drag the file you saved earlier into this now opened folder
4. Then click the `>` arrow to enable the pack, ignore any version errors


Now the pack is installed, there is a simple process to start the game:

1. Either host the server or load up the world on Minecraft Realms
2. If you want to enable teams, run `/scoreboard players set enable_teams global 1`
3. Teams can then be assigned with `/team join [name] red/blue/green (green only available with 3 teams)`
4. Once you're ready, run `/function lavarising:start` and let the games begin!

Upon adding the datapack, a simple setup flow will help you get the event up and running.
