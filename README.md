# plexion.dev

the one-stop shop for minecraft datapacks, resourcepacks & maps. the next generation of plexion.dev, since the [rebuild](https://github.com/plexiondev/plexiondev.github.io/commit/2bde6fc2aad26dfc77420b7028e530e3aac0c207) in june.

## what can it do?

a full [library](https://plexion.dev/library) is available, sporting minecraft datapacks, resourcepacks and maps that are used in my videos; with individual pages for each project showing screenshots, video previews, pack information and more. all things to do with the project library are done using the github api, synced live meaning that commits and hosting of files is not required in this repository. you can find the projects over in the [plex1on](https://github.com/plex1on) org.

short hyperlinks also exist:

* plexion.dev/library/x - **l.plexion.dev/x**, **lib.plexion.dev/x**
* plexion.dev/watch/x - **w.plexion.dev/x**
* plexion.dev/downloads/x - **d.plexion.dev/x**, **dow.plexion.dev/x**

## accessibility

the page comes pre-installed with both the **opendyslexic** and the **atkinson hyperlegible** font to aid people with fonts that may be more suitable for them. these settings can be found on the bottom of the page and by clicking the accessibility button on all page headers (this button is not available on mobile)

## dependencies

as previously said, this project utilises the github api to power both the [project library](https://plexion.dev/library) and the individual projects themselves as of 2021.720.0 (compiled 20/07/2021). this will mean that an internet connection is required if hosted locally and rate limits/hour can be exceeded and prevent usage of most of the website for periods of time.

fonts are also imported directly from google fonts, rather than being locally sourced - **except with the accessibility fonts available**. in cases where the site is being accessed offline, the page will attempt to load core system fonts such as; arial, helvetica, san francisco and sans-serif.
